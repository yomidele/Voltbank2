# VoltBank 💳

A **demo online banking website** built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
Features include:
- User registration & login
- Unique account numbers
- Deposits, withdrawals
- Transfers between users
- Transfers to external banks
- Transaction history

⚠️ **Note:** This is a **frontend-only demo** — no backend, no real money.  
For real banking features, you need a backend + APIs.
